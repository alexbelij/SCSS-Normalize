# Normalize-CSS

Resets the User Agent Style Sheet in a browser to a base easier to build on in CSS frameworks.

## Files

/src - contains the SCSS content you can use as a starting point for all SASS projects

/build - compiled CSS if you want to just use the reset css

## Additional Information

While I try to maintain as much of the look and feel of the origin content there are changes in here specifically for my preferences. The body color, for instance, is set to an off-white. This is my prefered default, but I change it based on the needs of any project I may start. As a developer you can use the SCSS content to build out whatever look and feel you'd like. This is just the starting point.
